# Number-Guessing-Game
This project is a simple C number guessing game that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player guesses the number, and the program gives hints to guess higher or lower until correct. It then shows the total number of guesses, demonstrating basic C concepts like input/output, loops, and conditionals.

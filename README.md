# Number Guessing Game in C

## About
A simple C program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player guesses the number, and the program provides hints to guess higher or lower until the correct guess is made, then displays the total number of guesses. This project demonstrates basic C concepts, including input/output, loops, random number generation, and conditional logic.

## Rules
- Guess a number between 1 and 100.
- The program will hint if the guess should be higher or lower.
- The game ends when the correct number is guessed.
- The total number of guesses will be displayed.
